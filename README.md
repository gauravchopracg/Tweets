# Twitter-Sentiment

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis. The code uses the [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)  library to access the Twitter API and the [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose. 

## Dependencies

* tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
* textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

```

```

##Credits

This code is 100% Siraj baby.
